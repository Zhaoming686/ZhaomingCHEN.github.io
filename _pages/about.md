I am currently a master student in the Mathematics and Computer science at Harbin Institute of Technology, specializing in subgraph mining or pattern mining. I am set to graduate in January 2025, under the supervision of Prof. [Guoting Chen](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/detail/article/617?lang=en). I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science (Mathematics and Computer Science) from Yanshan University.


I am now seeking a PhD position. 

My strengths now lie mainly in graph and mathematics. However, after writing four research papers, I believe I have a high level of coding proficiency. 

Therefore, I hope to find new research directions, ideally related to the fields I have previously worked on. 

In the six months before I begin my PhD, I am willing to learn any necessary knowledge.
